# TrapRunner (HTML/CSS Version)

This is a static HTML and CSS version of the TrapRunner application interface. It provides a visual representation of the different screens based on the original design proposal.

This version does not include any dynamic functionality, data fetching, AI integration, or backend logic. It is purely for visual layout and styling reference using basic web technologies.

## Files

- `*.html`: HTML files representing the different pages (Dashboard, Traps, Escalated, Users, Settings).
- `styles.css`: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the application, including layout, colors, and component styles.
- `assets/`: Directory for any static assets (like icons, if not using inline SVG).

## Opening the App

Simply open the `.html` files (e.g., `dashboard.html`) in your web browser.
